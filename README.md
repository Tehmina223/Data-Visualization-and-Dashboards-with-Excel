**Data Visualization and Dashboards with Excel**

The objective of this project is to analyze the historical trends in car sales for SwiftAuto Traders. The goal is to provide insights on car sales and profits for each dealer.
For this project, I have created visualizations using Excel.

The datasets used in this lab comes from Automotive_Industry.zip in the IBM Accelerator Catalog. I am using a modified subset of that datasets for this project.

**Task Information**

**TASK 1**: Developed a bar chart to capture **Quantity Sold by Dealer ID** sorted in ascending order of quantity sold. Used the pivot table on Sheet1 to construct the **bar chart** with “Dealer Id” as X axis and “Sum of Quantity Sold”on Y axis.

**TASK 2**: Developed a line chart to capture **Profit by Date and Model**. Used the pivot table on Sheet 2 to construct the **line chart** using “Profit” as X axis and “Date“ as Y axis.

**TASK 3**: Developed a column chart to capture **Profit by Year and Dealer ID**. Used the pivot table on Sheet 3 to construct the **column chart** using “Profit” as X axis and “Year“ as Y axis.

**TASK 4**: Developed a line chart to capture **Sum of Profits for Hudson model cars by Dealer ID**. Used the pivot table on Sheet 4 to construct the **line chart** using “Profit” as X axis and “Dealer Id“ as Y axis keeping the legend on the right side of the chart.
